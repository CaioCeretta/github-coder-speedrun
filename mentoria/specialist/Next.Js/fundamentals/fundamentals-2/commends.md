## Before x After

### Before

In the past, computer programs were a bundle of technologies, which could generate collateral effects

The techs mas mostly HTML, CSS, JS, and we basically we created a folder for each technology and organized the project
based on it.

It was usually a mess with low scalability, and, added to it, there were some technologies server side, such as PHP/Java,
which were also part of the mess.

### Now

Nowadays, our applications are organized in components, a component is the union of HTML + CSS + JS/TS, and it have this
idea of being a fragment of an application, which can receive inputs to parametrize these components in order to show it
in the way desired.

The frameworks that fit are, for example, angular from the version 2 up to now; Vue.js; React; Flutter, are all based
in components.

In the end, we'll end up having a component tree, let's use a login page as an example:

Page > Header > Logo, Menu > MenuItem, Content > Title, Main, Footer > Logo, Links
